## Welcome to xiaoxin83121's GitHub Pages

### Intros
Here is a personal Blog based on Github Pages. You can start this simple blog by following steps.
- Create a repos named username.github.io
- Choose a style theme in Settings
- If there is a README, https://username.github.io will direct with the content of README
- To add new pages, create new markdown file in repos. For example, a file with directory of about/contact.md, you can find it in https://username.github.io/about/contact  (without .md)
